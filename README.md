# Pokemon Clone Website

This is a project where I've created a clone of the Pokemon website using HTML and CSS. It's a static website designed to mimic the appearance and functionality of the original Pokemon website. The website is not responsive at the moment.

## Usage

This project can be used as a reference for practicing HTML and CSS skills, and for understanding how to mimic the appearance of a popular website like Pokemon.
